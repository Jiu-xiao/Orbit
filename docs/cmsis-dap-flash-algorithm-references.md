# DAP-02A Flash Algorithm References

This file records the references used for DAP-02A. The implementation does
not vendor an FLM from a CMSIS-Pack, OpenOCD, or pyOCD distribution. The
STM32F103C8, STM32F407 and STM32H723 images are compiled from the original sources in
`native/cmsis-dap-flash-algorithm/`.

## STM32H723 verified facts (2026-08-25)

Register facts verified against the ST sources above. CMSIS-DAP hardware
acceptance P7-1 through P7-5 ran on STM32H723VGT6 with CMSIS-DAP_LU
(VID `C251` PID `F001` serial `LU_2022_8888`, HID). J-Link P7-6 ran on the
same board with a J-Link (V9.56, VID `1366` PID `0101`, S/N `000164000406`).
Evidence JSON is in `outputs/h723-p7/`. Long-run disconnect (P7-7) is
deferred.

## Architecture decision

Three designs were compared:

1. CMSIS-Pack/RAM algorithm: selected. The host validates the ELF and target
   before erase, places the original algorithm image, stack, and page buffer in
   SRAM, sets the CMSIS-Pack registers, and accepts completion only at the
   trusted BKPT.
2. An OpenOCD-shaped loader: not selected as an implementation source. Its
   GPL-2.0-or-later code cannot be silently copied into this MIT extension, and
   adding OpenOCD as a runtime owner would violate the project's one-owner
   boundary.
3. Host-side register programming: not selected. It would make every Flash
   controller sequencing detail and polling policy part of the host/DAP
   critical path, while still requiring a target-side memory-write primitive.

The selected implementation is a clean-room, source-built loader family:
STM32F407VET6 (512 KiB Flash), STM32F407IG (1 MiB Flash), and
STM32H723VGT6 (1 MiB Flash). It is
deliberately narrower than a general CMSIS-Pack engine. A future user-provided
Pack/FLM can be accepted via `cmsisDapFlashAlgorithmPath`, but an algorithm
with unknown redistribution rights is rejected rather than embedded.

## STM32F407IG adaptation (2026-10-02)

The IG density is 1 MiB per [ST's STM32F407IG product page](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f407ig.html).
RM0090 defines the same F4 controller with twelve sectors: four 16 KiB,
one 64 KiB, and seven 128 KiB, covering `0x08000000–0x080FFFFF`.
The added sectors 8–11 start at `0x08080000`, `0x080A0000`,
`0x080C0000`, and `0x080E0000`. The IG profile uses the existing read-only
preflight registers (`DBGMCU_IDCODE=0xE0042000`, DEV_ID `0x413`, Flash
capacity at `0x1FFF7A22`) and requires 1024 KiB before any algorithm call.
The family ID and capacity do not distinguish package variants or prove an
exact SKU; the configured name must agree with the board/project.

`scripts/build-native.ps1` builds `orbit-stm32f407ig-flash-algorithm.bin`
from Orbit's existing MIT-licensed `stm32f407_flash_algorithm.c` and linker
script with `ORBIT_F407_FLASH_SIZE_KIB=1024`. The original `stm32f407`
image remains a 512 KiB build; sectors 8–11 are excluded from that image.
Both images retain the fixed entry offsets and use the 128 KiB ordinary
SRAM window, keeping the existing exclusion of CCM PT_LOAD segments.
No external binary or vendor source code is embedded. On 2026-10-02 the
user confirmed normal operation on the current IG board/firmware after the
128 KiB sector RAM-validation fix. This is basic user hardware confirmation;
full-sector/bank coverage, additional probes/transports, and long-run/disconnect
acceptance remain unverified. The confirmed fix is recorded in
`docs/bug-fix-log.md`.

## STM32F103C8T6 adaptation (2026-10-06)

This profile registers exactly `STM32F103C8T6` and the project shorthand
`STM32F103C8`. It uses the existing CMSIS-DAP owner, SWD/Cortex-M control,
Flash RPC and scheduler. It does not register F103CB, other packages,
GD32/CS32-compatible parts or undocumented capacity above 64 KiB.

| Target/algorithm fact | Value / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Main Flash | 0x08000000–0x0800FFFF; pages 0–63, each 1024 bytes; last page 0x0800FC00 |
| SRAM / ELF and loader | 0x20000000–0x20004FFF; code at 0x20000000, 4-byte aligned page buffer after code, 4 KiB stack ending at 0x20005000 |
| Preflight | DPIDR 0x1BA01477; DBGMCU at 0xE0042000, DEV_ID 0x410; 0x1FFFF7E0 must report exactly 64 KiB before Init/erase/program |
| FPEC | KEYR +0x04, SR +0x0C, CR +0x10, AR +0x14; SR BSY b0 / PGERR b2 / WRPRTERR b4 / EOP b5; CR PG b0 / PER b1 / STRT b6 / LOCK b7 |
| Programming | 2-byte granularity; merge ELF loads sharing a halfword, then pad odd addresses/tails with erased 0xFF before 1 KiB upload slices; ProgramPage batch limit 64 KiB, further bounded by available loader RAM |
| Protection / clocks | Mask interrupts; enable HSI and wait for ready without changing SYSCLK/PLL/prefetch; never write option bytes or mass erase; UnInit locks FPEC; HSI remains on until reset |
| Timing / failures | Bounded target polling; host erase/program defaults 5 s; return 1 timeout, 2 protection/lock, 3 program/verify/range error; do not write FPEC registers while still busy or replay unknown writes |
| Image / ABI | Original Orbit MIT C source plus linker script, ARM GCC Cortex-M3 / Thumb / soft ABI; entry offsets 0x000/0x100/0x200/0x300/0x400, trusted BKPT at 0x500; no static data (R9/static_base 0), unchanged page buffer for Verify |
| SVD | Existing resolver derives series STM32F103 / pack ID Keil.STM32F1xx_DFP for both names; user-supplied SVD precedence unchanged. Actual Pack/SVD download and Peripheral Viewer have not been verified; no SVD binary is bundled by this adaptation |

Automation covers all page starts, cross-page payloads, the final valid Flash
byte, SRAM/BSS and .data VMA/LMA bounds, halfword merging/padding, identity and
capacity rejection before any algorithm operation, and selected-owner target
resolution. The actual native helper mock uses the built F103 image within
20 KiB RAM to check ABI/layout, first/last-page erase/program/Verify/read-back,
misaligned and out-of-range requests, and stack overflow rejection. The mock
emulates Flash effects; it does not execute the FPEC code on silicon.

Hardware has not been connected or modified for this adaptation. HID and
WinUSB Flash/debug, original chip markings/REV_ID, RAM stub, Init/UnInit,
real ELF verification, Watch/Timeline/RTT, disconnect and long-run behavior
remain pending board acceptance. Use the staged acceptance in
`.agent/skills/cmsis-dap-add-target/references/acceptance.md` with an explicitly
authorized board/ELF and test-page range. Reverting this profile, its optional
host alignment, algorithm source/build entry and tests removes the adaptation;
the existing F407/H723 profiles and their algorithm images remain independent.
